Poetry (Extracts) 
"The Bonnett" Who's the maid with face so fair With lilly hand and glove upon it; With modest air and auburn hair, And the 11curl" beneath the Bonnett? 
With pouting lip and rosy cheek And modest dimple on it, And eye of blue that seems to speak "So kind" beneath "the Bonnett." 
The graceful step of fairy foot With tiny slipper on it, Oh! Who could meet and then be mute The charms beneath "the Bonnett?" 
Where's the form and graces too, To swell the song or sonnett; Where's the "look" that is so true As the "Smile" beneath the "Bonnett." 
From the Columbian Sentinel (Stephen)

Wednesday December 31, 1828. The weather very cold and stinging. Business not very good. Not much business in the Legislature that is very interesting now. This is the last day of another year, going never to be recalled. What a solemn thought ought to arise from this, that we are one year nearer the end of our lives than we was when it began.:Look back on the days which old "1828" has numbered and see the millions that ascended to the Bar of their God. It becomes us then to look forward on the approaching year as our last and to be prepared accordingly and with this I say to the closing year, "Farewell, 1828."
